# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a high-performance multi-threaded work-stealing executor to the Zuki async runtime while preserving the existing single-threaded executor. The new executor will leverage lock-free data structures, work-stealing algorithms, and dynamic thread pool management to provide excellent performance for CPU-intensive and highly concurrent workloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Zuki, I want a multi-threaded executor option so that I can leverage multiple CPU cores for better performance in concurrent applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a WorkStealingExecutor THEN the system SHALL provide a multi-threaded task execution environment
2. WHEN tasks are submitted to the WorkStealingExecutor THEN the system SHALL distribute them across available worker threads
3. WHEN the WorkStealingExecutor is configured THEN the system SHALL allow specifying the number of worker threads
4. IF no thread count is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the number of logical CPU cores

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want work-stealing capabilities so that idle threads can help busy threads, ensuring optimal load balancing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker thread has no tasks in its local queue THEN the system SHALL attempt to steal tasks from other threads
2. WHEN a thread's local queue becomes full THEN the system SHALL overflow tasks to a global queue
3. WHEN stealing tasks THEN the system SHALL steal approximately half of the victim thread's tasks to amortize stealing cost
4. WHEN multiple threads attempt to steal from the same victim THEN the system SHALL handle contention gracefully using lock-free algorithms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want batch task submission so that I can submit multiple related tasks efficiently with reduced synchronization overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL provide a batch submission API
2. WHEN a batch is submitted THEN the system SHALL minimize synchronization operations compared to individual submissions
3. WHEN a batch is processed THEN the system SHALL distribute tasks optimally across worker threads
4. WHEN creating a batch THEN the system SHALL allow building batches incrementally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want lock-free data structures so that the executor provides high performance without blocking threads on locks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing task queues THEN the system SHALL use lock-free atomic operations
2. WHEN threads coordinate THEN the system SHALL avoid mutex-based synchronization where possible
3. WHEN managing thread state THEN the system SHALL use atomic state transitions
4. WHEN handling queue operations THEN the system SHALL ensure ABA safety and memory ordering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dynamic thread pool management so that the executor can adapt to workload demands efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the executor starts THEN the system SHALL spawn the configured number of worker threads
2. WHEN the executor shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate all worker threads
3. WHEN threads are idle THEN the system SHALL put them to sleep to save CPU resources
4. WHEN new work arrives THEN the system SHALL wake up sleeping threads as needed
5. WHEN shutting down THEN the system SHALL ensure all in-flight tasks complete or are properly cancelled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the multi-threaded executor to integrate seamlessly with existing Zuki abstractions so that I can use the same Task, Future, and Waker APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the WorkStealingExecutor THEN the system SHALL accept the same Task types as SingleThreadedExecutor
2. WHEN futures are polled THEN the system SHALL provide the same Context and Waker interfaces
3. WHEN tasks wake up THEN the system SHALL properly schedule them on appropriate worker threads
4. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to switch between executor types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and resource management so that the multi-threaded executor is robust and doesn't leak resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN thread spawning fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue with available threads
2. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL propagate errors appropriately
3. WHEN the executor is dropped THEN the system SHALL clean up all allocated resources
4. WHEN tasks panic THEN the system SHALL isolate the panic to the affected task without crashing other threads

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration options so that I can tune the executor for different workload characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the executor THEN the system SHALL allow setting the number of worker threads
2. WHEN configuring the executor THEN the system SHALL allow setting thread stack sizes
3. WHEN configuring the executor THEN the system SHALL allow setting queue capacities for performance tuning
4. WHEN using default configuration THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults for typical workloads
