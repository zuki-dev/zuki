# Zuki Async Runtime - Multi-threaded Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the integration of advanced thread pool concepts from the analyzed code into the zuki async runtime. The implementation will be done in phases to ensure stability and maintainability.

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing**: Single-threaded executor with priority queues
- **Existing**: Basic waker system with task scheduling
- **Existing**: Future/Poll pattern similar to Rust
- **Missing**: Multi-threaded execution
- **Missing**: Work stealing
- **Missing**: Lock-free data structures
- **Missing**: Advanced synchronization primitives

## Key Features to Extract from Thread Pool Code

### 1. Lock-Free Data Structures
- **Node-based intrusive linked lists** - Memory efficient, no allocations during operations
- **Lock-free MPMC queue** - Multi-producer, multi-consumer with atomic operations
- **Ring buffer with work stealing** - High-performance task distribution
- **Atomic synchronization state** - Packed struct for efficient state management

### 2. Work Stealing Algorithm
- **Local task buffers** - Each thread has its own buffer to reduce contention
- **Hierarchical task queues** - Local buffer → local queue → global queue → steal from others
- **Efficient steal strategy** - Steal half the tasks to amortize stealing cost
- **Target-based round-robin** - Fair stealing pattern across threads

### 3. Advanced Thread Management
- **Dynamic thread spawning** - Spawn threads on demand up to max limit
- **Graceful shutdown** - Coordinated shutdown with proper cleanup
- **Thread registration** - Lock-free thread stack for management
- **Idle management** - Efficient sleep/wake with futex-based events
