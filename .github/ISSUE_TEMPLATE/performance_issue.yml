## Performance Issue Description

**What performance problem are you experiencing?**
A clear description of the performance issue (e.g., slow execution, high memory usage, etc.).

**Expected Performance**
What performance characteristics did you expect?

**Actual Performance**
What performance are you actually seeing?

## Measurements

**Benchmark Results**
```
// Include relevant benchmark results, timing data, or profiling information
Benchmark: [name]
Time: [duration]
Memory: [usage]
CPU: [usage]
```

**Comparison Data**
If you have performance comparisons (e.g., with other runtimes, previous versions), include them here.

**Performance Regression?**
- [ ] Yes, this worked better in a previous version
- [ ] No, this has always been slow
- [ ] Not sure

If yes, what was the last working version? [version]

## Environment

**System Information:**
- OS: [e.g., Windows 11, macOS 13.0, Ubuntu 22.04]
- Architecture: [e.g., x86_64, aarch64]
- CPU: [e.g., Intel i7-12700K, Apple M2, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X]
- RAM: [e.g., 32GB DDR4-3200]
- Zig Version: [e.g., 0.12.0]
- zuki Version: [e.g., 0.1.0]

**Build Configuration:**
- Build Mode: [e.g., Debug, ReleaseFast, ReleaseSafe, ReleaseSmall]
- Target: [e.g., native, x86_64-windows, etc.]
- Optimization Flags: [any custom optimization settings]

## Reproduction

**Reproduction Code**
```zig
// Minimal code that demonstrates the performance issue
const std = @import("std");
const zuki = @import("zuki");

pub fn main() !void {
    // Your performance test code here
}
```

**How to Measure**
Instructions for reproducing the performance measurements:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

**Dataset/Workload**
Describe the data or workload used in your performance test.

## Analysis

**Profiling Data**
If you have profiling data (CPU, memory, etc.), please include it:
- Call graphs
- Memory allocation patterns
- Hot paths
- Cache miss rates

**Suspected Cause**
If you have any ideas about what might be causing the performance issue:

**Impact Assessment**
- [ ] Critical - Makes the runtime unusable
- [ ] High - Significantly impacts performance
- [ ] Medium - Noticeable performance degradation
- [ ] Low - Minor performance impact

## Additional Context

**Workarounds**
Any workarounds you've found that improve performance.

**Related Issues**
Links to related performance issues or discussions.

**Performance Requirements**
What performance characteristics are required for your use case?

## Checklist
